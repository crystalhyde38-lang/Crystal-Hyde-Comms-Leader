                            <h4 style="color: #d32f2f; margin-top: 0;">⚠️ The Challenge</h4>
                            <p><strong>Global Initiative:</strong> Visa announced $500,000 in grants to women-owned small businesses across 64 Women's World Cup matches—each Player of the Match award would trigger a grant to a woman-owned business in the winning athlete's country ($5,000-$50,000 based on match stage)</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>The Conflict:</strong> Canada's established <em>She's Next Grant Program</em> (launched 2021) was already awarding $10,000 grants + mentorship to individual women entrepreneurs—50 recipients to date. The World Cup program would create duplication and confusion.</p>

                            <p><strong>Partner Pivot:</strong> I proposed redirecting Canadian Player of the Match grant funding to the <strong>Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB)</strong> to support Indigenous women-led businesses</p>
                            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Strategic Rationale:</strong> Serve a distinct audience, avoid program conflict, advance economic reconciliation, and create differentiated positioning for Visa Canada</p>
