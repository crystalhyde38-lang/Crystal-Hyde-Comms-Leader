    <h4>Strategic program alignment challenge</h4>
    <h4>Challenge:</h4>
    <p>Visa's global FIFA Women's World Cup 2023 small business grant program ($500,000 across 64 matches) conflicted with Canada's established She's Next Grant Program (running since 2021, already supporting 50 female entrepreneurs with $10,000 grants + mentorship)</p>
    <h4>My Solution:</h4>
    <p>Proposed partnering with Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB) to direct Canadian Player of the Match grant funding to Indigenous women-led businesses‚Äîa distinct audience avoiding duplication while advancing economic reconciliation</p>
    <h4>Results:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>$25,000 CAD</strong> initial contribution to CCAB + additional funding tied to Canadian player wins</li>
        <li><strong>Dual-track success:</strong> Maintained integrity of She's Next program while fully participating in global World Cup initiative</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic differentiation:</strong> Only country to create culturally-focused approach addressing unique national priorities</li>
        <li><strong>Community impact:</strong> Advanced economic reconciliation through Indigenous women entrepreneur support</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable partnership:</strong> Established ongoing relationship between Visa Canada and CCAB beyond tournament</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why This Mattered:</h4>
    <p>This strategic decision demonstrated how thoughtful communications planning can align global corporate initiatives with local market realities. Rather than creating competing programs or diluting existing efforts, the CCAB partnership allowed Visa Canada to honor both its World Cup sponsorship commitments and its established She's Next brand while serving an underrepresented community.</p>

    <!-- The Challenge -->
    <div style="background: #fff; border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; border-radius: 6px;">
        <h4 style="color: #d32f2f; margin-top: 0;">‚ö†Ô∏è The Challenge</h4>
        <p><strong>Global Initiative:</strong> Visa announced $500,000 in grants to women-owned small businesses across 64 Women's World Cup matches‚Äîeach Player of the Match award would trigger a grant to a woman-owned business in the winning athlete's country ($5,000-$50,000 based on match stage)</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>The Conflict:</strong> Canada's established <em>She's Next Grant Program</em> (launched 2021) was already awarding $10,000 grants + mentorship to individual women entrepreneurs‚Äî50 recipients to date. The World Cup program would create duplication and confusion.</p>

        <p><strong>Partner Pivot:</strong> I proposed redirecting Canadian Player of the Match grant funding to the <strong>Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB)</strong> to support Indigenous women-led businesses</p>
